# FakePeggle

## Introduction
* FakePeggle is a project that aims to faithfully replicate the game **Peggle**, described on the internet as a *casual puzzle video games*.  
* Basically there is a 2D map filled with blue and orange pieces (circle and rectangle) called in the game **pegs**.  
* A **cannon** placed high-center fires a **ball** that fall and hit the pegs.
* A **chest** in the bottom of the board moves horizontally

>Note: The project was concerned only as desktop application.  

## Rules
* For this project I established some primitive rules from the original games
* **Win Condition**: the main goal of the game is to hit all the orange pegs with the white balls
* **Lose Condition**: the game end if all the available balls have been shot
* If the ball hit the chest you gain a bonus ball (+1 on the available ball counter)
